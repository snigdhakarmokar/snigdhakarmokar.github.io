The desire to work as a pediatric physiotherapist stemmed from my post-graduation days, when I was in my master's program doing specialization in neurosciences. I had an encounter with a chirpy little girl who was diagnosed with Downs Syndrome, while talking to her for 2 minutes, we became friends. During the course of her therapy, my interest grew stronger in this field and I wanted to learn more about neurological disabilities predominant in kids.

After completing my bachelor's degree in physiotherapy from Padmashree. Dr. D. Y. Patil University and subsequent masters with a specialization in Neurosciences from NMIMS University. I joined the Pediatric Physiotherapy Department in  Dr. L. H. Hiranandani Hospital as a physiotherapist. I had the opportunity to work with varied cases involving, cerebral palsy (CP), developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder, learning disorders, genetic conditions like Guillian barre syndrome, Duchhenes muscular dystrophy, giant axonal neuropathy, reubenstein taybii etc. The interventions focused on achieving functional independence using neurodevelopmental therapy and sensory integration Therapy. to understand more about the treatment approaches, I then learned about neurodevelopmental therapy and completed my NDTA Certification in 2019. 

As a developing country, the resources and the infrastructure in India for treating children with special needs are scarce. It is even more challenging for the kids who are born in the lower economic strata of the society.  While working as a physiotherapist at [RAAY Foundation](https://raayfoundation.com/) and Gharkul Public Trust that especially catered to the single mothers and parents coming from low income group, I tried to implement cost-effective rehabilitation mechanisms that can be performed without sophisticated instruments and raised awareness among the parents.   

At present, I continue to work as an independent practitioner providing therapy for the adult and pediatric cases in a home-based setting. I intend to rejoin academia for pursuing my doctoral studies soon.
