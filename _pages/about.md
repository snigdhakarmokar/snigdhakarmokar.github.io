After finishing my bachelor's degee in physiotherapy from Padmashree. Dr. D. Y. Patil University and subsequent masters with a specialization in Neurosciences from NMIMS University I started my clinical pratice in major hospitals as a medical provider in Mumbai, such as Nanavati hospital and Hiranadani Hospital. As a developing country, the resources and the infrustructure related to treating children with special needs incredibly challenging in the lower economic strata of the society. As a measure, I along with some of my physiotherapist colleagues, started working as a part of an NGO [Raay foundation](https://raayfoundation.com/) that especially cattered to the single mothers and parents with low income group. 

I am currently working as an independent practitioner in home based setting from 2014 as  a Pediatric Physiotherapist. i have worked as a pediatric physiotherapist in Hiranandani hopsital,Mumbai from 2017 to 2019. i have done my NDTA Certification on 2019.
