Patil University and subsequent masters with a specialization in Neurosciences from NMIMS University I started my clinical practice in major hospitals as a medical provider in Mumbai (including Nanavati and Hiranadani Hospital, two of the most well-equipped medical facilities in India). As a developing country, the resources and the infrustructure related to treating children with special needs incredibly challenging in the lower economic strata of the society. As a measure, I along with some of my physiotherapist colleagues, started working as a part of an NGO [Raay foundation](https://raayfoundation.com/) that especially cattered to the single mothers and parents with low income group.
