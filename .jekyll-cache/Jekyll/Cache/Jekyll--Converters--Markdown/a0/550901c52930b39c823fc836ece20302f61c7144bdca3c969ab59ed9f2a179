<p>Hi I am Hirak, a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu">Harvard</a>  with Prof. <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/peter-kharchenko">Peter Kharchenko</a>.  I completed my Ph.D in Computer Science from the <a href="www.cs.umd.edu">University of Maryland</a> under the guidance of Prof. <a href="http://www.robpatro.com/">Rob Patro</a>. I primarily work on two broad areas of computational biology. On one hand, I design ultra fast mapping algorithms and compression schemes for raw sequencing data. On the other hand, I also work on the application of machine learning algorithms to analyze heterogeneous, large-scale public datasets.</p>

<h1 id="academic-background">Academic Background</h1>
<p>Before my research assistantship at UMD, I completed a Masters (M.S.) in Computer Science at Stony Brook University and a Masters of Technology (M.Tech) at Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta (more focused towards theoretical computer science).  At the Indian Statistical Institute, I defended my masters thesis in graph theory (which gained <em>erdos number</em> of <a href="images/erdos.png">3</a>, which is closest I could have gotten to). For a brief stint, I was a researcher at the CS department at National University of Singapore and a junior research fellow at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur.</p>
